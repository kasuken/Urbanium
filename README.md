**Urbanium** is a deterministic, agent-based city simulation designed to study **emergent urban behavior**.  
It models a city as a set of explicit systems (economy, geography, institutions) and a population of constrained citizens whose decisions are bounded, observable, and reproducible.

Urbanium is **not a game** and **not a chatbot city**.  
It is a systems-first experiment framework.

## Why Urbanium exists

Most “AI city” projects fail for the same reasons:
- agents improvise instead of obeying constraints
- outcomes are narrative, not measurable
- results cannot be reproduced
- cost and complexity explode with scale

Urbanium takes the opposite approach:

- The **world owns truth**
- Agents propose actions, the world validates them
- Decisions are bounded and enumerable
- Metrics matter more than stories

The goal is to explore how **macro-level patterns emerge from micro-level rules** under controlled conditions.

## Core principles

- **Deterministic by default**  
  Same seed, same inputs, same outcome.

- **World-first architecture**  
  Time, economy, geography, and institutions are simulated explicitly.

- **Bounded agents**  
  Citizens choose among a small, valid set of actions. No free-form text.

- **Explainable behavior**  
  Every decision can be traced back to state, traits, and constraints.

- **Metrics over narrative**  
  Employment, rent, mobility, inequality. Not “what the agent felt”.

## What Urbanium is (and is not)

### Urbanium is
- An agent-based simulation engine
- A policy and systems experimentation sandbox
- A platform for studying emergence
- Compatible with rules, utility models, GOAP, or small local language models

### Urbanium is not
- A digital twin of a real city
- A generative storytelling system
- A social roleplay environment
- A reinforcement learning benchmark (yet)
