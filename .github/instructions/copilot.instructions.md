# Urbanium

Urbanium is a deterministic, agent-based city simulation designed to study emergent urban behavior.

It models a city as a set of explicit systems such as economy, geography, and institutions, and a population of constrained citizens whose decisions are bounded, observable, and reproducible.

Urbanium is not a game and not a chatbot city.
It is a systems-first experiment framework.
